Write an efficient function that checks whether any permutation ↴ of an input string is a palindrome. ↴
A palindrome is a string that's the same when read forward and backward.

Examples:

civic
mom
anna
kayak
racecar

You can assume the input string only contains lowercase letters.

Examples:

"civic" should return True
"ivicc" should return True
"civil" should return False
"livci" should return False
"But 'ivicc' isn't a palindrome!"

If you had this thought, read the question again carefully. We're asking if any permutation of the string is a palindrome. Spend some extra time ensuring you fully understand the question before starting. Jumping in with a flawed understanding of the problem doesn't look good in an interview.
